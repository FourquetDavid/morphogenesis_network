The original group consisted of 49 students, but due to 'university drop-outs' and after deleting those who did not fill in the questionnaire four or more times, a group was obtained of 32 students for whom almost complete data are available. The students were asked to rate their relationships on a six point scale, with response categories described as follows. Label Description of the response categories, 1. Best friendship Persons whom you would call your 'real' friends, 2. Friendship Persons with whom you have a good relationship, but whom you do not (yet) consider a 'real' friend, 3. Friendly relationship Persons with whom you regularly have pleasant contact during classes. The contact could grow into a friendship, 4. Neutral relationship Persons with whom you have not much in common. In case of an accidental meeting the contact is good. The chance of it growing into a friendship is not large, 0. Unknown person Persons whom you do not know, 5. Troubled relationship Persons with whom you can't get on very well, and with whom you definitely do not want to start a relationship., There is a certain risk of getting into a conflict Next to the sociometric data, available individual characteristics are sex, education program, and smoking behavior. Smoking was only allowed in special areas. As a consequence, the 'smokers' had to separate themselves from the 'non-smokers' if they wished to smoke (which they often did during coffee and lunch breaks). Thus, contact opportunities differed between actors because of their smoking behavior. The education program was important because, although all started to study at the same moment, there were three groups, following different courses. During the first months all programs overlapped largely, but after a few months, the programs diverged. Especially the 2-year program was quite different from the other two programs. Therefore, this attribute also gives information on the individuals' contact opportunities.",University Freshman who completed all 7 surveys.,true,true,17 Original students are excluded as data is not available for all time periods.

A small part of Wikipedia contributors are administrators, who are users with access to additional technical features that aid in maintenance. In order for a user to become an administrator a Request for adminship (RfA) is issued and the Wikipedia community via a public discussion or a vote decides who to promote to adminship. Using the latest complete dump of Wikipedia page edit history (from January 3 2008) we extracted all administrator elections and vote history data. This gave us 2,794 elections with 103,663 total votes and 7,066 users participating in the elections (either casting a vote or being voted on). Out of these 1,235 elections resulted in a successful promotion, while 1,559 elections did not result in the promotion. About half of the votes in the dataset are by existing admins, while the other half comes from ordinary Wikipedia users., , The network contains all the Wikipedia voting data from the inception of Wikipedia till January 2008.

Nodes have an attribute classname that indicates the school class and grade of the corresponding individual. Teachers are all assigned to the Teachers class. Edges between A and B have two weights associated with them: duration, which is the cumulative time spent by A and B in face-to-face proximity, over one day, measured in seconds (multiples of 20 seconds); and count, which is the number of times the A-B contact was established during the school day.

Among other things, they investigated visiting relations between families living in haciendas (farms) in a neighborhoods called Attiro and a village called San Juan Sur., , These three networks have various vertex and edges attributes available. For the San Juan Sur networks, the investigators proposed an ethnographic classification of the families into six family-friendship groupings on substantive criteria. In rural areas where there is little opportunity to move up and down the social ladder social groups are usually based on family relations. This is the vertex attribute grouping. , For the San Juan Sur newtork, both the visiting and death message relations, have two vertex attributes that were collected. The first is an ethnographic classification of the families into 14 social status groups indicating the average importance of the family's members (class numbers 1 to 14; higher classes represent higher status).

In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature.

The network of visiting ties is a simple directed graph: each arc represents ""frequent visits"" from one family to another. The exact number of visits was not recorded. Line values classify the visiting relation as ordinary (value one), visits among kin (value two), and visits among ritual kin, i.e., between god-parent and god-child., , The investigators proposed an ethnographic classification of the families into six family-friendship groupings on substantive criteria.

The diffusion process was successful since the new method was adopted in a relatively short period by most schools. The example traces the diffusion of the modern math method among school systems which combine elementary and secondary programs in Allegheny County (Pennsylvania, USA). All school superintendents who were at least two years in office were interviewed. They are the gatekeepers to educational innovation because they are in the position to make the final decision. The researchers obtained data from 61 out of 68 superintendents, 51 of whom had adopted by 1963 (84%). Among other things, the superintendents were asked to indicate their friendship ties with other superintendents in the county with the following question: Among the chief school administrators in Allegheny County, who are your three best friends?, , The researcher analysed the friendship choices among the 38 interviewed superintendents who adopted the method and were in position at least one year before the first adoption, so they could have adopted earlier. Unfortunately, the researcher did not include the friendship choices by superintendents who did not receive any choices themselves; they are treated as isolates. In the original network, some friendship choices are reciprocated and others are not (ModMath_directed.net) but we will use the symmetrized network (ModMath.net). A line in this network indicates that at least one superintendent chooses the other as his friend. The year of adoption by a superintendent's school is coded in the partition ModMath_adoption.clu: 1958 is class (time) one, 1959 is class (time) two, etc. The first adopter (v1) is a superintendent with many contacts outside Allegheny County but few friends within the county.

It came under Austrian control until the fall of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918., , In Ragusa, all political power was in the hands of male nobles older than 18 years. They were members of the Great Council (Consilium majus) which had the legislative function. Every year, 11 members of the Small Council (Consilium minus) were elected. Together with a duke, the Small Council had both executive and representative functions. The main power was in the hands of the Senat (Consilium rogatorum) which had 45 members elected for one year. This organization prevented any single family, unlike the Medici in Florence, from prevailing. Nevertheless the historians agree that the Sorgo family was all the time among the most influential., , The Ragusan nobility evolved in the 12th century through the 14th century and was finally established by statute in 1332. After 1332, no new family was accepted until the large earthquake in 1667. A major problem facing the Ragusan noble families was that by decreases of their numbers and the lack of noble families in the neighbouring areas, which were under Turkish control, they became more and more closely related - marriages between relatives in the 3rd and 4th remove were frequent.

Joint stock companies are owned by the shareholders, who are represented by a board of directors. This opens up the possibility of interlocking directorates.

46,7: Norwegian Boards (Aug09),http://toreopsahl.com/datasets/sdsdasdasd,"This is the interlocking directorate among 384 public limited companies in Norway (Allmennaksjeselskap or ASA). The list of companies is created by selecting all companies listed as public limited companies on the website of the Norwegian Business Register on August 5, 2009. For each company, we downloaded public announcements containing changes to the boards composition since November 1999. From these announcements, we extracted monthly affiliation (or two-mode) networks since May 2002 (see website for choice of cut-off). Corresponding one-mode projections are also available. We strive to keep the data updated by downloading new announcements around the middle of each month.","Seierstad, C., Opsahl, T., 2011. For the few not the many?

From this list, we excluded employee representatives as the legislation does not affect them in the same way. Since mistakes could have occurred while entering the data and people can change their name, this list was manually cleaned by studying the compositions over time and comparing the changes. For example, Alexandra Bech Gjørv has been a director of Schibsted ASA from 2001 until 2007. However, in 2001 and 2002, her name was listed as simply Alexandra Bech. Without the manual cleaning, she would have been included as two people in the dataset., , To determine the sex of the directors in our dataset, we collected lists of all male and all female first names belonging to more than 200 people in Norway from Statistics Norway. We cross-referenced these two lists with the first names of the directors. However, some first names were not in either of the lists, and some first names were included in both lists. In an effort to avoid having missing data, we conducted a web search to determine the gender of directors with these names.",,false,,,,,,,4,,/datasets/original/missing.png,2013-06-18 16:15:05 UTC,2013-12-11 01:29:39 UTC,,,,
